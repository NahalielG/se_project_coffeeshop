  Hello, My name is Nahaliel Green and this is my 2nd project that I created as a software engineer.This project showcases the use of BEM,animations, positioning elements(absolute,relative, etc),
  
  animations, trasnsitions, iframe,forms,buttons,and organizing my code using the @import rule in css. My primary focus was building off my first project where I learned BEM and flexbox and adding cool 
  
  feautures like a form, iframe, and animations. The form element is a very important feauture of a website in todays landscape of web design forms are everywhere.With this project I was able to really 
  
  dive deep into the makeup and features of a form (input fields,labels,type values,etc).  In addition I was able to implent youtube tutorial videos on the landing page using iframe. In closing I was 
  
  able to implement annimations like a pulse , and smooth gradient trasnsitions to really bring life to the landing page!
